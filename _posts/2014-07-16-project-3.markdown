description: A project aimed at analyzing data on mosquito traps laid to curtail the spread of
            the West Nile Virus in Chicago. Along with the weather data, clear patterns emerged
            about the conditions in which the virus thrives.
            <br><br>
            A predictive model using Random Forests
            was developed to indicate the areas in which Chicago health department should concentrate to reduce
            spending on laying traps.
