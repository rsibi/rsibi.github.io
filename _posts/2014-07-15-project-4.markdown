description: Completed this project as a part of the course "Applied Predictive Analytics for Business" at Texas A&M. In
             this project, we aim at finding a good model which can accurately predict whether a loan applicant would default
             in the future or not. More importantly, tree based models were explored to supplement the work that has already been done in this area.
            <br><br>
            An XGboost model proved to the best among the chosen methods under the given assumptions.
